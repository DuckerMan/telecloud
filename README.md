## What is it?
It's a file storage where all your files are stored in Telegram servers. So, it works like:

1. You upload file
2. Telecloud uploads it to temp directory then split the file into the chunks
3. Telecloud uploads it to Telegram and delete temp file and chunks

## Where can I download releases?
You can download it [there](https://github.com/DuckerMan/telecloud/releases)

## Missing features:

- [ ] Delete files
- [ ] WebDAV support (**help wanted**)
- [ ] File downloading 
- [ ] Make code less shitty
